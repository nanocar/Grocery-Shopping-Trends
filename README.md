I plan to eventually read the receipts from a picture and automate it, however, there's plenty of steps I can do before getting stuck with the first part. I will manually transcribe receipts for now so that I can start gathering data and seeing ways to track trends of the food, which is my main goal anyways. I need to first figure out how to get my data into a database to easily query it.
